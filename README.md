## What I still need to do
* Watch more videos/practice more Java.
* Study more technical interview questions.
* Connect with more people on LinkedIn.

## What to do before starting a job
### Technical
* I'd like to work more on technical questions related to different languages, specifically Java. We barely scratched the surface of the information that is out there and it would be nice to learn some more stuff. To do this I would need to spend more time on working with videos related to Java and learn more about different database systems.

### Non-technical
* Non-technical issues that I need to work further on would be getting more LinkedIn connections and working on cover letters. Otherwise, I feel pretty ready to continue the search for a job.
