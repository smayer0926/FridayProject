* Practice on Hack Reactor
* Read through example questions from a technical interview [Technical Questions](http://www.java2novice.com/java-interview-questions/)

## What I still need to do
* Watch more videos/practice more Java.

## What to do before starting a job
* I'd like to work more on technical questions related to different languages, specifically Java. We barely scratched the surface of the information that is out there and it would be nice to learn some more stuff. To do this I would need to spend more time on working with videos related to Java and learn more about different database systems.
