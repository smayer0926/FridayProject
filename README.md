* Practice on Hack Reactor

## What I still need to do
* Watch more videos/practice more Java.

## What to do before starting a job
* I'd like to work more on technical questions related to different languages, specifically Java. We barely scratched the surface of the information that is out there and it would be nice to learn some more stuff.
